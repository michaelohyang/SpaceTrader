# SpaceTrader

**Purpose**
I developed this game with my teamates for an Object Design class that focuses on Unified Process-based projects.
Unified Process utilized several iterations to reduce workload and spread the work throughout multiple weeks.
Throughout the course, I learned about GRASP principles, as well as SOLID principles. I also learned about DCD, SSD, Domain Model, Use Case Diagrams, and the proper definition of project testing.
After a thorough analysis, I realized that there were many Code Smells in the project which I plan to fix and update to make it more visually appealing

**Gameplay**
You are a SpaceTrader that travels around the universe to trade items with merchants in the Market. Each market is unique because of it's technology level. Higher technology level corespond to higher quality items being sold. There will be pop-up Space Bandit, Space Police, and Wandering Merchant throughout your journey. The difficulty option defines how strong these NPCs are in the game. Higher difficulty causes the NPC to be stronger and more annoying because they will pop-up more often.
